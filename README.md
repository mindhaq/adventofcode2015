Solutions for adventofcode.com

adventofcode.com posted coding problems like a advents calendar in December 2015. As I was travelling in Asia
during that time, something limited like that was a good way to keep my coding skill fresh without
having to spend too much time.

To make the whole thing a bit more challenging, I try to use as many programming languages as I can,
possibly a different one for each day.

Day 1: Python

My Pyhton skills are pretty basic. So far I have only used for scripting small things, and always
learning only what I needed for the small problems I had to solve.

Seems like a good match for adventofcode as well ;)

Day 2: PHP

End of January 2016 I stayed on the Philippines. Their currency is the Philippine Peso, an (Erbe)
from the times when they were a spanish colony. The shortcode for it is PHP.

I learned PHP back in 1999, when it was still sometimes referred to as Personal Home Page. Already back
then, it was the easiest way to get server side code running on a webserver. Much of my early career
as a software developer was about writing a lot of PHP code. I'm not doing that much anymore, but
then Spain doesn't have the Peso anymore as well.
