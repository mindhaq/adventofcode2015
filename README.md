Solutions for adventofcode.com

adventofcode.com posted coding problems like a advents calendar in December 2015. As I was travelling in Asia
during that time, something limited like that was a good way to keep my coding skill fresh without
having to spend too much time.

To make the whole thing a bit more challenging, I try to use as many programming languages as I can,
possibly a different one for each day.

Day 1: Python

My Pyhton skills are pretty basic. So far I have only used for scripting small things, and always
learning only what I needed for the small problems I had to solve.

Seems like a good match for adventofcode as well ;)
